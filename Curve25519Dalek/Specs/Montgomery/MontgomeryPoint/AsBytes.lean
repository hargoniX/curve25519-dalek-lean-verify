# Spec theorem for `curve25519_dalek::montgomery::MontgomeryPoint::as_bytes`

• Returns a reference to the internal byte array representation of the `MontgomeryPoint`
• The function is a `const fn`, meaning it can be evaluated at compile time
• In Lean, since `MontgomeryPoint` is defined as `Array U8 32`, this is essentially the identity
