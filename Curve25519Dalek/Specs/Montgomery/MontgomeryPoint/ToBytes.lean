# Spec theorem for `curve25519_dalek::montgomery::MontgomeryPoint::to_bytes`

• Converts the `MontgomeryPoint` to a 32-byte array
• The function is a `const fn`, meaning it can be evaluated at compile time
• In Lean, since `MontgomeryPoint` is defined as `Array U8 32`, this returns the array directly
• The difference from `as_bytes` is that this returns an owned array (not a reference in Rust terms)
